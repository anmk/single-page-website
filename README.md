# Single Page Website

![GitHub repo size](https://img.shields.io/github/repo-size/anmk/single-page-website?style=plastic)

This Single Page Website was built using HTML, CSS/Sass, Bootstrap and jQuery. I used the Owl Carousel, bxSlider, XH-Generator and Grunt too. I also added Parallax effects. This project is fully responsive.
